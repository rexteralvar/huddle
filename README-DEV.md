# Huddle Landing Page
This is a simple static landing page built from scratch which demonstrates my skills for the technologies being used. Basically, what I did is I converted the layout given by frontendmentor into a working live site.


## Technologies used
+  HTML5 - for markup
+  CSS3- used SaSS and CSS Grid for this site
+  Fontawesome - icon source
+  GitHub - hosted the site
+  VS Code - code editor being used
